# UTalk
A demo p2p instance messaging backend
## Goal
- Build in Kademlia distributed network. (P.S. Normally, IM is built with CS architecture mixed with P2P in file transfering. P2P-IM is a decentralized way to enhance security and performance.)
- Build node watchers to observe errors and performance in each node.
